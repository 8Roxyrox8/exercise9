#Continous Integration  

>continuous integration is to run a series of processes continuously to
>the management control quality.The main objective is to improve software 
>quality and reduce delivery times

**Advantage**

+Early detection errors  
+Reduced integration time  
+Minimizing Risks  
+Generate a higher quality code  

**Disadvantages**  

-We need time initial implementation  
-It is essential to develop a good test-suite for test automation to get performance  
-The large-scale refactoring can be problematic due to the continuous evolution of the code base
